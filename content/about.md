# About this AKS Architecture App

## Real Life Experience

Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is [**Julie Ng**](https://julie.io/who/). I am a [speaker](https://julie.io/who/speaker/), failed entrepreneur, former UX designer and full stack engineer. After running out of money, I joined [Allianz Germany](https://allianz.de) as they started their cloud migration in 2016. Because of my cloud-native background, I quickly jumped from engineering to Enterprise Architecture and mentored dozens of teams and hundreds of developers in the Agile Training Centers across Munich and Stuttgart. 

It was exciting and a privilege to be a part of the agile transformation of a multi-billion euro insurance company. If you're curious about what I did, check out my 2018 confernece talk [DIY Full-Stack JavaScript CI CD](https://speakerdeck.com/jng/enterjs-diy-full-stack-javascript-ci-cd).

In 2019 Microsoft recruited me and today I am a FastTrack Engineer at Microsoft where I help onboard customers and their workloads to Azure.

## Why did you create this?

I enjoy talking with engineers and architects about the challenges they face when deploying to the cloud. But sometimes it can be repetitive. More importantly, I felt everyone deserves this guidance and the value of my expertise, not just select Microsoft customers. How can I teach and enable more people? 

As a [**YouTuber**](https://www.youtube.com/c/JulieNgTech) I started by publishing video walkthroughs, focussing on CI/CD automation and pipelines. While videos are engaging, they are not interactive.

## Experience is not a Checklist

Part of my job is to contribute to Microsoft resources, especially documentation to help customers. But in my opinion our existing frameworks and tools, for example [Well-Architected Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=azure-architecture-review) and [Azure Security Center Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls) are not good enough. 

Existing tools lack context and as such it can give a Pokemon, "Gotta Catch Them All" impression. Not everyone needs the starship enterprise. Sometimes a bicycle or a car is enough. The tools are overwhelming, with either too many questions (the assessment) or too much noise (security center). It's daunting to start. And once you do, it's not a good experience.

What if you could enjoy revieiwng your architecture? 

What if you could learn and discover at your own pace?
