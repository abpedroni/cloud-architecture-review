# How does your AKS Design measure up?

<p class="lead">
	There is no single perfect cluster design or configuration. Instead ask yourself - how well does my cluster design meet my business requirements?

## Values

This app was built with the following philosophy and values in mind:

- **There is no single correct answer.**  
	Even if we break down Microsoft recommendations into Contoso, Fabrikam and Trey Research customer scenarios, it does not recognize the diversity of the customers and their requirements. This limits the _individual impact_ of the recommendations we make. We can do better.

- **Real-Life Engineering Experience results in "it depends" answers.**  
  Cloud adoption is a _journey_. So often our decisions will be different based on previous experience, even if we have similar requirements.

- **No free fish. I want to teach you to fish.**  
	This means the app refrains from prescriptive recommendations. Instead the focus is to help you _make a decision_ and understand the _consequences_ of that decision across multiple dimensions.

## Proof of Concept

As of December 2021 this is a mostly a proof of concept to communicate a vision. The technology reflects the direction. But the content is just as important and currently needs more love to be the honest but "caring advisor" I want it to be.
