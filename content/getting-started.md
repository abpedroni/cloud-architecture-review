# Understanding the Results

Most documentation and checklists by definition give advice based on 1 linear dimension. In this application, every decision you make can potentially affect 4 dimensions

- Complexity
- Operations
- Security
- Cost

Higher is ***not*** better. You'd want to optimize, i.e. reduce costs and save money, right? For more details, continue to the <NuxtLink to="/review/score">**Understand Your Scores**</NuxtLink> page after you've answered at least 1 question.
